            <h3>Critical Mass</h3>
            <p>
                    This is a key term when discussing the spread of information over social media. And no, that does not mean the minimum amount of mass required to create a nuclear reaction in this instance. Rather what is meant by critical mass in this scenario is the concept that “indicates that a social movement explodes after some threshold of participants or actions have crossed,” (Zhu, 4).
            </p>
            <h3>Mob Mentality</h3>
            <p> A bit more popular of a term, mob mentality refers to the behavior of a group versus a single individual. When posed in a lerger group setting, the neurological behavior of the brain shifts, as actions that are typically deemed immoral are no longer viewed as such. This is due to the inabiliity to place blame on a single person as there is a whole group responsible for whatever action occurs. This can be an extemely dangerous methodology online.</p>
            <h3>Attachement Motivation</h3>
            <p>What this terminology is defined as “a personality attribute that indicates an individual’s desire for social interaction and social communication,” (Zhu, 4). Basically, what this means in the viewpoint of Twitter is that the building of debate and community through conversation is what allows it to be so successful and influential. When looking at a different form of social media such as Snapchat or Instagram, the same sort of attachment motivation is not produced. </p>
            <h3>Collective Behavior</h3>
            <p>Collective behavior is very similar to mob mentality, but Dan Zhu gives a good example in the example of twitter: “The individual’s behavior intention is very possibly altered when a large number of followees are reposting a topic. In addition, the user could view the reposted times of a tweet. The tweet with a high number of times being reposted may be preferentially attached and inspires more reposting behavior,” (Zhu, 5). Basically what is described by the author here is that a large amount of self-inflicted pressure typically occurs when viewing popular tweets with racial or cultural ideas and allow them to be supported and spread even further.</p>
            <h3>Reasoned Action</h3>
            <p>What this theory states is that “the model assumes that most behaviors of social relevance (including health behaviors) are under volitional control, and that a person's intention to perform a behavior is both the immediate determinant and the single best predictor of that behavior,” (Sutton, 1). In layman's terms, the way social media affects people is relatively predictable now, so it makes the measurement of influence from social media possible. </p>
            <h3>Forced Response</h3>
            <p>What is meant by this is that when you send a direct message, you know when the recipient has received it and this plays a large role in modern communication between younger generations. It is highly expected that you respond promptly after viewing messages. In our current culture, when we fail to see a response from someone, we typically assume the worst and that we are no longer liked by the recipient.</p>
