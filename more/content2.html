                <h3>Critical Mass</h3>
                <p>Once a social movement such &num;BlackLivesMatter for example, reaches a certain threshold amount of retweets, the amount of daily retweets grows exponentially in turn. While this was originally for social movements not related to social media, it has since been reinvented to be suitable for such concepts through social media. A more recent application of critical mass can be seen with the &num;MeToo movement, in which a large number of people are coming out against sexual harassment related issues from their pasts. What can be gathered by this is minimal if you only look at these facts. But if you look at the users who are participating in these movements, most are teens, and of adult twitter users, 40% are between ages 18 and 29 (Statista). This helps to further cement the point that the younger generations are the ones able to utilize these social media mediums in order to further advance and influence cultural ideas.</p>
                <h3>Mob Mentality</h3>
                <p>When viewing popular tweets with racial or cultural ideas, a large amount of self-inflicted pressure typically occurs and allow them to be supported and spread even further. This means that even if a person did not explicitly endorse and idea before and simply supported it in silence, they have now changed their actions due to the awesome power of republishable social media.</p>
                <h3>Attachement Motivation</h3>
                <p>To reiterate what was previously said, in the viewpoint of Twitter is that the building of debate and community through conversation is what allows it to be so successful and influential. When looking at a different form of social media such as Snapchat or Instagram, the same sort of attachment motivation is not produced. This can be in part due to the formatting of response on Snapchat and Instagram, because they do not so easily support public conversation. Instead, they seem to promote more one on one conversation through direct messaging. </p>
                <h3>Collective Behavior</h3>
                <p>Similar again to mob mentality, popular tweets with controversial ideas can rise up very easily, as people join hands in a sort of anonymity. This type anonymity is a loose term, as you can still trace each individal, but it's the fact that they are not treated as individuals that allows this 'individual' anonymity to produce. </p>
                <h3>Reasoned Action</h3>
                <p>Basing my ideas on reasoned action of a study, the focus of the study was to see if certain organizations’ twitter popularity could be increased by changing how they used Twitter. Originally these companies were described as using Twitter improperly and sent out tweets deemed ‘monologic’ (Lim, 1). What these researchers mean by this and the improper usage of Twitter is that these companies could gain much more from social media that works like Twitter by changing their marketing strategy to something similar to a conversation. A conversation between a company and its consumers. By switching to this conversation style, the researchers found that a greater ‘social presence’ was apparent in these companies’ Twitter feeds. What this means is that the consumers were more willing to communicate and spread their thoughts and ideas with these companies (Lim, 1). While this research itself was accomplished with more corporate Twitters, the same can be applicable with cultural and racial tweets, in fact even more so.</p>
                <h3>Forced Response</h3>
                <p>This is highly expected that you respond promptly after viewing messages. In our current culture, when we fail to see a response from someone, we typically assume the worst and that we are no longer liked by the recipient. This sort of social anxiety leads to people instantly responding without a second thought of what they sent. With the inability to know what they are saying, people are unable to fully process what has been said and what they are responding, and in doing so, are incapable of being heavily influenced by culturally or racially based media on Snapchat or Instagram, and in a similar fashion they are unable to spread information as fast and as effectively than usage through twitter.</p>
